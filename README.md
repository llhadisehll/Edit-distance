# Edit-distance
In this project, we examined the English texts of 86 famous English-language novels. In this exercise, we removed the stop words. We extracted the words that are separated by 1, 2 or 3 in each document and calculated their semantic similarity using the WuPalmer method from WordNet. Then based on each document, we saved the list of pairs of words and their distance and brought the semantic similarity. The result of this research is to examine the similarity of words that are used nearby. In other words, we want to check whether words near each other have the same meaning or not.
